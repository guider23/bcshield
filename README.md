**BC Shield** is an all-in-one, lightweight JavaScript security script designed to protect your web pages from common threats and unwanted interactions. It provides runtime protections such as:

- Blocking your site from being embedded inside iframes (preventing clickjacking),
- Detecting and blocking access when Developer Tools are open (to prevent code tampering or inspection),
- Bot traps to detect automated form submissions,
- Disabling right-click and common copy/paste keyboard shortcuts to prevent content theft,
- A sanitizer utility to clean input strings from malicious characters.

BC Shield is not free it requires subscription activation to ensure it works on your sites.

BC Shield runs entirely on the client side without dependencies, injecting necessary CSS and safeguards dynamically, giving you a simple, configurable layer of protection â€” all packed inside a single self-contained JavaScript file.

# BC Shield - Online Installation Guide

Add the following script tag to your HTML file, ideally before the closing `</body>` tag or inside the `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xxx/bcshieldxx@yourdomain/bc-shield.js" defer></script>
```

- The `defer` attribute ensures the script loads **after** your HTML content is parsed.
- No additional setup needed â€” just include the script and youâ€™re protected!
